### Crates

### _AeroRust crates_

#### NMEA

  NMEA 0183 sentence parser for Rust. Currently only GGA, GSV, GSA, VTG and RMC sentences are supported.

  Repository: https://github.com/AeroRust/nmea
  crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/nmea
  Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183

  Type: **parser + no_std**

#### arsdk-rs

  SDK (Software development kit) for https://parrot.com drones

  Repository: https://github.com/AeroRust/arsdk-rs
  Parrot: https://parrot.com

  Type: **SDK**

#### Splice

  Splice is a DSL (Domain-specific language) for Software-Defined Satellite Applications

  Repository: https://github.com/AeroRust/splice

  Type: **DSL**

### _Other crates_

#### yaiouom

  Extensible, strongly-typed units of measure, with a custom type system (based on F#'s unit of measures) implemented as a linter.

  This crate implements a mechanism of units of measure. It may be used to manipulate all sorts of measures, including physics/engineering (m, kg, s, A, m * s ^ 1, ...), currencies (EUR, USD, ...), statistics (dollars per barrel, engineers per lightbulb, dollars per household per year, ...)

  crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/yaiouom

  Repository: https://github.com/Yoric/yaiouom


#### Labrador-LDPC
  A crate for encoding and decoding low-density parity check (LDPC) error correcting codes.

  crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/labrador-ldpc

  Repository: https://github.com/adamgreig/labrador-ldpc

  Type: **no_std only**

#### CCSDS Primary Header
  This crate contains an implementation of the CCSDS standard called Space Packet Protocol,
  which defines a packet header called the CCSDS Primary Header.

  crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/ccsds_primary_header

  Repository: https://github.com/nsmryan/ccsds_primary_header

  Type: **?**

#### NYX
  Nyx is a high fidelity, fast, reliable and validated astrodynamical toolkit library written in Rust.

  The target audience is researchers and astrodynamics engineers.
  The rationale for using Rust is to allow for very fast computations, guaranteed thread safety,
  and portability to all platforms supported by Rust.

  crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/nyx-space

  Repository: https://gitlab.com/chrisrabotin/nyx

  Type: **?**

#### YANP
  YANP - Yet Another NMEA Parser.

  A no_std Rust NMEA 0183 sentence parser.

  crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/yanp

  Repository: https://github.com/hargoniX/yanp

  Type: **parser + no_std**

#### BP7
  Bundle Protocol 7 encoding/decoding library.

  A portable Work-In-Progress [implementation](https://github.com/dtn7/bp7-rs) of the upcoming delay-tolerant networking [Bundle Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis-24).
  Support for DTN (Delay-Tolerant Network) as well as IPN (InterPlanetary Network) addressing, custom canonical blocks and restricted environments such as wasm.

  crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/bp7

  Repository: https://github.com/dtn7/bp7-rs

  Type: **?**

#### DTN7
  Delay-tolerant Networking Daemon and CLI tools.

  A Work-In-Progress [implementation](https://github.com/dtn7/dtn7-rs) of the upcoming delay-tolerant networking [standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dtn-bpbis-24).
  This crate uses *BP7* to provide a dtn daemon (with routing, convergence layers, etc) and command line tools.

  crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/dtn7

  Repository: https://github.com/dtn7/dtn7-rs

  Type: **?**
